Ingredients:
 - 3 tablespoons honey 
 - 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
 - 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 - 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 
 - 2 large ripe pears, cored and sliced

     Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
  2. Stir 3 tablespoons honey, the lemon juice, 1/4 
  	 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon ginger together in a small bowl; spread evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange the sliced pears in 2 rows.
  3. Beat the eggs, milk, 1 tablespoon honey, 1/4

  	 and golden brown, about 20 minutes.

  	 spatula to lift each portion out of the pan and turn pear side up. Sprinkle with toasted almonds and drizzle with any syrup left in the baking dish.
